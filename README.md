# Hook Form

Created a form that takes user information and dynamically displays it to the page.
upon submission, the user data is turned into a newUser object with which something could be done with. I just log it to the console in this example.

There were 2 objectives for this assignment

- create from inputs for first name, last name, email, password, and confirmation password fields
- In real time, display the form data being typed into the form

I also added basic form validation that renders based on certain conditions (not enough characters, passords not matching, etc).
